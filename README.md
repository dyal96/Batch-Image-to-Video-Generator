## 🎞️ Batch Image to Video Generator — v1.0

### 🔧 Overview

This is a **drag-and-drop batch script** to convert a sequence of images into a smooth, crossfaded video using FFmpeg — with full control over orientation, transitions, fit/stretch mode, frame duration, and frame rate.

No software installation required — just FFmpeg and Windows.

### ✨ Features

* ✅ **Drag & Drop Images** — Just drop your images onto the `.bat` file.
* 🖼️ **Choose Orientation** — Horizontal (1920x1080) or Vertical (1080x1920).
* 🔍 **Fit or Stretch** — Choose whether to fit images inside the frame (with black bars) or stretch them to fill completely.

* 🎞️ **Frame Rate Control** — Set FPS for your final video (default: 25 FPS).
